2. Factorial Calculator:
Implement a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given positive integer.
3. Simple Calculator:
Implement a calculator program that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) as input, performs the calculation, and handles division by zero using exception handling.
4. Pattern Printer:
Write a program that prints various patterns (like triangles or diamonds) of asterisks based on user input for the number of rows.
5. Student Grade Calculator:
